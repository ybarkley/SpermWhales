Load functions 
```{r}

source('./code/FromTaiki/gridFunctions_v3.R')
library(PAMmisc)
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(Distance)
```

##Load parameters
```{r}
surveynum = 1705
gridsize = 10
loctype = 'trackline'
loctype2 = 'trk'

```

##Load data if necessary
To revisit a data set:
*load grid or centroid data
*run GPS data again
*filter Pm detections for survey
*get centroids if needed
Then proceed to 'GRID QC' chunk below.
```{r}
#load grid data
gridEffort <- readRDS(here::here(paste0('output/gridEffort/', gridsize, ' km-', loctype), paste0('gridEffort', surveynum, '_', gridsize, 'km_', loctype2, '.rda')))

gridEffortNEW <- readRDS(here::here(paste0('output/gridEffort/', gridsize, ' km-', loctype), paste0('gridEffort', surveynum, '_', gridsize, 'km_', loctype2, 'NEW.rda')))
gridEffortOLD <- readRDS(here::here(paste0('output/gridEffort/', gridsize, ' km-', loctype), paste0('gridEffort', surveynum, '_', gridsize, 'km_', loctype2, 'OLD.rda')))
gridEffortRAW <- readRDS(here::here(paste0('output/gridEffort/', gridsize, ' km-', loctype), paste0('gridEffort', surveynum, '_', gridsize, 'km_', loctype2, '_raw.rda')))




#load centroid locations
centroidAll <- readRDS(here::here(paste0('output/centroids/', gridsize, ' km-', loctype), paste0('centroids',  surveynum, '_', gridsize, 'km_', loctype2, '.rda')))

```

##1. GPS data
```{r}
# EXAMPLE WORK FLOW
# 1) First read in gps, then you need to convert longitudes to 0-360,
# convert UTC to POSIXct format, and create a column called "effort" that is TRUE or FALSE
# Column names needed: Longitude, Latitude, UTC, effort
gpsAll <- read.csv(paste0('./output/straightPath results/straightPathWeffort_', surveynum, '.csv'), stringsAsFactors = FALSE) 

# gpsAll <- gpsAll %>% mutate_if(is.character, str_trim) #white space after join.veffort!?!?
gpsAll$effort <- gpsAll$straight == TRUE & gpsAll$join.aeffort == "on" # & gpsAll$join.veffort =="on"
gpsAll$Longitude <- ifelse(gpsAll$Longitude <= 0, gpsAll$Longitude + 360, gpsAll$Longitude)
gpsAll$UTC <- lubridate::ymd_hms(gpsAll$UTC)
```

###subset GPS for troubleshooting
```{r}

gpsAll <- filter(gpsAll, Id >= 146246 & Id <= 148253)

```



##2. Load sperm whale detection data
Includes localized acoustic encounters and sightings with acoustics only.
```{r}
# 2) Read in detections, convert column names to Longitude, Latitude, UTC,
# and "distance" if you need to create a detection function using Distance package
# Longitude must be matching 0-360 like in the GPS data

pmDets <- read.csv('./output/SpermiesFinalLR_20200804.csv', stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
# pmDets <- filter(SwEnvFinal, loc == 1 | loc == 0 & sid < 999) # localized encs and sightings

#### This is where you change the location from localized position to trackline position ####
pmDets <- rename(pmDets, Longitude =lon_trk2, # lon2, #
                         Latitude=lat_trk, #lat, #
                         distance = pdist)

pmDets$Longitude <- ifelse(pmDets$Longitude <= 0, pmDets$Longitude + 360, pmDets$Longitude)
pmDets$UTC <- lubridate::mdy_hm(pmDets$UTC)
pmDets$distance <- abs(pmDets$distance)*1000


# pmDets <- filter(pmDets, type == 'best' | sid < 999, itrk==1)
# pmDetsAc <- filter(pmDets, sid == 999)
# pmDetsub <- filter(pmDets, survey == surveynum, acid >= 71 & acid <= 74)
```

##Make detection function
```{r}
# 3) fit a detection function

#winner! See v2 for other variations
dsmAll_3pcthn <- Distance::ds(pmDetsAc, key = 'hn', truncation = '3%')

##Calculate BIG Grid 
```{r}

# 4) Run grid stuff. This will take a while, and should have a couple progress bars showing you how long the slow parts
# are taking. Set "trunc_m" to whatever truncation distance you might want to use
# It will ask you what pixel size you want  (this is the grid size), in the future you can specify this when you call it

# YB Sept 3, 2020: Make overall larger grid that can be reused for each spatial scale

#GRID QC
All detections should be included and each have effort > 0. Cells with zero effort cannot have centroids calculated. If all is well here, then proceed to centroids.
Otherwise, make changes to any detections in 'Resolve cell...' chunk.
```{r}
#1. check that all detections are included as expected. 
(pmDetsub$ID %in% gridEffort$detections$ID) #Should be all TRUE
data.frame(pmDetsub$ID , gridEffort$detections$ID) #if mismatch, this won't work

#2. which detections have effortArea = 0? (Which are deemed to have 0 effort? No bueno.)
(effdets <- which(gridEffort$detections$effortArea==0)) #output is the index
(effchg <- gridEffort$detections[effdets,]) #output is all info for each detection with 0 effort

#3. check for duplicate detections in the same cells
gridIndex <- as.data.frame(table(gridEffort$detections$gridIndex))
colnames(gridIndex) <- c('effCells', 'frequency')
gridIndex

if (length(effdets) == 0 & nrow(effchg) == 0){
print('All detections are included and have effort')
}

if ((nrow(gridIndex) == length(gridEffort$detections$ID)) == TRUE){
  print('Each detection occurs in its own grid cell')
} else {
  print('There are detections that occur in the same grid cell. Which ones?')
  gridTabl <- gridIndex[which(gridIndex[2] > 1),]
  detInd <- as.integer(gridEffort$detections$gridIndex)
  dupInd <- detInd[duplicated(detInd)] #get value of duplicated grid cell(s)
  gridTabl
}


```


#IF CELLS WITH WHALES EXIST WITH NO EFFORT
Do the following steps.
##1. Resolve whale cell(s) with no effort 
```{r}
#Map out the surrounding cells to find ones with effort nearby
gridmap <- attr(gridEffort$grid, 'map')

#Sometimes >1 detections have 0 effort, can look at all of them
# g = 1 # which row in effchg?
# GridInd = effchg[g,]$gridIndex # what grid cell is it in?
GridInd = effchg[,c(3,43)] # pull acid and gridIndex for all detections with no effort
gridEffort$effort$area[GridInd[,2]] # how much effort is in the cell? (Should be zero)

#Get cell index for the closest surrounding cells. Use stack to make one column for them.
GridSurroundtmp <-data.frame(t(gridmap[GridInd[,2],]))

GridSurround <- stack(GridSurroundtmp) #output 2 columns, 1: grid cell, 2: ac. ID
GridSurround$acid <- GridInd[,1]       #add column for ac ID
GridSurround <- GridSurround[,-2]      #remove 'ind' col of X1...X4 col names

GridEff <- data.frame(gridEffort$effort$area[GridSurround$values]) # get effort in surr cells
GridDir <- c('S', 'E', 'N', 'W') #make this vector
GridSurrDF <- data.frame(GridSurround, GridEff, GridDir) #combine surr cells and their effort and direction
colnames(GridSurrDF) <- c("gridID", "acid", "effort", "Dir")
GridSurrDF

#Get the centroid locations of the surrounding cells that have effort around the cell for the detection that has no effort.
CentSurround <- filter(centroidAll, effCells %in% GridSurrDF$gridID) #these cells all have effort

#JOIN centroids with grid map cells info and drop NAs (cells without effort)
GridCentJoin <- GridSurrDF %>% full_join(CentSurround, by = c("gridID" = "effCells")) 
GridCentJoin<-GridCentJoin %>% drop_na()
```

##2. Plot grid of whale cell(s) with no effort
REMEMBER: GridCentJoin only includes the surrounding cells, 'Dir', WITH effort, so not all 'Dir' directions may be included in the plot.
CHOOSE the replacement cells using the direction, GridCentJoin$Dir.
```{r}
x <- gridEffort2
actualArea <- as.numeric(st_area(x$grid))
coveragePct <- round(x$effort$area / actualArea, 3)
coveragePct <- ifelse(coveragePct > 1, 1, coveragePct)

pdf(here::here('figures', paste0('Grid', surveynum, '_', gridsize, 'km_', loctype, '_CHECK2.pdf')), width=11,height=8)

plot(x$grid, col = gray(1 - coveragePct, alpha = .9), lwd = 0.1)
points(x=x$gps$Longitude, y=x$gps$Latitude, col='blue', pch=15, cex = 0.05)
# points(x=pmDetsub$Longitude, y=pmDetsub$Latitude, col='green', pch=1, cex=0.1, lwd=0.1)
# text(pmDetsub$Longitude, pmDetsub$Latitude,col='magenta', labels=pmDetsub$acid, cex=0.1, lwd = 0.1 )
points(centroidAll$lon, centroidAll$lat, col='red', pch = 19, cex=0.1, lwd=0.1)
# points(x=pmDetsub$Longitude, y=pmDetsub$Latitude, col='green', pch=0, cex=0.2, lwd=0.1)
points(	191.1134, 24.82075, col='darkorchid', pch=8, cex=0.1, lwd=0.1) #grid locations of 
# text(	191.1134, 24.82075,col='black', labels=pmDetsGrid1705$acid, cex=0.1, lwd = 0.1 )
points(	192.0295, 21.76568, col='darkorange', pch=8, cex=0.1, lwd=0.1) #grid locations of 
# text(	192.0295, 	21.76568, col='black', labels=pmDetsGrid1705$acid, cex=0.1, lwd = 0.1 )
# points(192.7076, 24.31634, col='magenta', pch = 0, cex=0.2, lwd=0.1) #where is this centroid compared to the actual location? for 1303 sighting to change depth to -697
# points(192.7200, 24.28700, col='goldenrod', pch = 0, cex=0.2, lwd=0.1) #where is this centroid compared to the actual location?

#plot detections and their centroids missing effort
# text(x=effchg$Longitude, y=effchg$Latitude	, col='magenta', labels=effchg$acid, cex=0.1, lwd = 0.1 )
# points(x=effchg$Longitude, y=effchg$Latitude	, col='orange', pch = 19, cex=5, lwd = 0.07 )
# text(GridCentJoin$lon, GridCentJoin$lat, col='darkviolet', labels=GridCentJoin$Dir, cex=0.1, lwd=0.1)

#plot detections missing in the centroid data
# text(x=CentMiss$Longitude, y=CentMiss$Latitude	, col='magenta', labels=CentMiss$acid, cex=0.1, lwd = 0.1 )
#  points(x=CentMiss$Longitude, y=CentMiss$Latitude	, col='orange', pch = 19, cex=0.07, lwd = 0.07 )

dev.off()


```


##3. Replace whale cells with no effort
```{r}

#change values for gridIndex, effortArea, and actualArea in 'gridEffort$detections' while keeping everything else the same
CentNew = 1 #c(1,4)  #represents the row number(s) in GridCentJoin that corresponds with the correct dir
#!! 'newCell' will change depending on the survey and spatial scale #
newCell <- GridCentJoin[CentNew,1] # Select the gridIndex for the new cells based on the plot

newEffArea <- gridEffort$effort$area[newCell] # get the effort for each new cell from original grid
newActArea <- actualArea[newCell] # get the new cell's actual area

#This replaces the old cell without effort with info for the new cell in these 3 cols
effchg2 <- effchg %>% mutate(gridIndex = newCell, effortArea=newEffArea, actualArea=newActArea)

#remove old effchg and replace with new cell info in the detections list
gridEffort$detections <- gridEffort$detections[-effdets,] #effdets is the index from grid detections
gridEffort$detections <- rbind(gridEffort$detections, effchg2) #bind new cell info with rest of grid detections

#original rows from 'effdets' index should be missing with the new cells at the bottom 
 View(gridEffort$detections)
 
```

#4. Save new grid data
!!! Check that all whale cells have Effort > 0
```{r}
saveRDS(gridEffort, here::here(paste0('output/gridEffort/', gridsize, ' km-', loctype), paste0('gridEffort', surveynum, '_', gridsize, 'km_', loctype2, '.rda')))
```

#5. Run centroids again
```{r}
centroidAll <- gridCentroid(gridEffort, gpsAll)
```


#Verify Centroids
##1. Check that all centroids with presences have effort as expected.

At this point, all presences AND absences should have effort > 0.
Presences can be filtered using detections$gridIndex 
```{r}

#do another check to make sure all detections have centroid locations WITH EFFORT
(all_prz <- dplyr::filter(centroidAll, pa==1))

print('Do the number of presences in the centroids match the number of encounters?')

if((nrow(all_prz) == nrow(pmDetsub))==TRUE){
  print('Hooray! Each enc is located in its own cell')
} else {
  print('Oopsy! May have >1 enc per cell. Lets sort it out, itll be fun, I swear...' )
  
  centroidAlltmp <- filter(centroidAll, pa != 1)     #remove the rows with presences
  
  dupRow <- subset(all_prz, effCells == dupInd)      #subset the duplicated rows
  all_prz = all_prz[!(all_prz$effCells == dupInd), ] #remove duplicated rows based on the effCell value

  for (dup in 1:length(dupInd)){
    dupRow$pa[dup] <- dupRow$pa[dup] + (gridTabl[dup,2]-1) #For each duplicate, take the (total enc-1) and add it to the pa column
  }
  print(dupRow)                                      #check that the pa column is correct
all_prz = rbind(all_prz, dupRow)

} ## We want TRUE, but FALSE could mean 2 detections in one cell

centroidAll <- centroidAll[all_prz$effCells


```

##2. Do if centroids with presence is missing effort.

```{r}
### IF DETECTIONS MISSING IN CENTROIDS ###
#Are there any missing detections or mismatches in detections between the grid data and the centroid data? These should all be 0
nrow(all_prz)
nrow(pmDetsub)
allPrz <- all_prz$effCells
allPrz[!( allPrz %in% gridDets)]

table(gridDets)
table(allPrz)

(notINgrid <- (all_prz$effCells[!all_prz$effCells %in% gridEffort$detections$gridIndex])) 
(notINcent <- (gridEffort$detections$gridIndex[!gridEffort$detections$gridIndex %in% all_prz$effCells]))         




#which detection is missing in the centroid data?
CentInd = which(gridEffort$detections$gridIndex == notINcent) #outputs index
CentMiss = gridEffort$detections[CentInd,]
# Do more if things don't match, but they should and all should be well.
# (id_not <- which(!(gridIndex$Var1 %in% all_prz$effCells == TRUE))) #find the detections that don't match up
# (not_det <- gridEffort$detections[id_not,]) #this is hopefully empty. These are the detections NOT IN the centroids

```


##3. More Checks
Some cells with presences were passed more than once. These need to have the correct times associated with them to retrieve the correct environmental data. This chunk finds the detections that occur > 1, picks the time that is within a day of the detection UTC, and assigns it to that detection.
THEN, it takes the other cells that don't match the detection UTC and assign it to pa = 0, so it's still counted but not as a presence, pa = 1. 
The same process is done for the absences, where any effort spanning more than 2-3 days are identified and included as separate 
```{r}
#### PRESENCE DATA ####
# `dbl_prz` and `dbl_det` should have the same number of rows
#Need to know which time (start or end) is associated with a detection if pa = 1 and diff_mins > 1440 (mins in a day)
dbl_prz <- dplyr::filter(centroidAll, abs(diff_mins) > 1440 & pa == 1)

#In cells with PRESENCE, which detections occur in cells that were passed > 1 time
dbl_idx <- which(gridEffort$detections$gridIndex %in% dbl_prz$effCells == TRUE)
dbl_det <- gridEffort$detections[dbl_idx,]
dbl_det <- dbl_det[order(dbl_det$gridIndex),] #detections in order of gridIndex to match dbl_prz
nrow(dbl_prz) == nrow(dbl_det) #should be true

## For some cells with pa = 1, the start and end times are not within a day of the detection time for the same location (cell centroid). The detection times are compared to the start and end times. Those times that differ by less than a day are used. 
idt1 = which(abs(difftime(dbl_det$UTC, dbl_prz$start, units = "mins")) < 1440) #find rows where time difference btwn detection and start is less than a day
idt2 = which(abs(difftime(dbl_det$UTC, dbl_prz$end, units = "mins")) < 1440)   #find rows where time difference btwn detection and end is less than a day
