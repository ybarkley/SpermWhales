#### This document summarizes the results of the sperm whale distribution models for COMBINED and ACOUSTIC-BASED data sets.




### UPDATE: Oct 17, 2020  


Foraging Models are based on combined data using all sightings with concurrent acoutic encounters and groups that were only acoustically detected.

### Research Hypothesis: Sperm whales are found in deep, productive offshore waters.  

#### To address my hypothesis, I built generalized additive models (GAMs) to:  
##### 1. Describe the relationships between biologically relevant environmental predictors and sperm whale encounter rate. Sperm whale encounter rate represents the number of groups of sperm whales occurring within a grid cell as the unit of analysis. The estimated number of individual sperm whales per grid cell was not used as the response variable because it cannot be accurately estimated using acoustics data at this time.


##### 2. Examine whether these relationships differed depending on the type of data included in the models by configuring the following model types:  
  * **Acoustics Only models**    
     * These models included sperm whale encounters that were ONLY detected by acoustics (both localized and unlocalized)  
     * Included only data for times when the acoustics team was 'on effort'
     * n = 124 sperm whale encounters
  * **Combined Data models**    
     * Models included both sperm whale sightings and acoustic encounters
     * Included only data for times when both visuals and acoustics teams were 'on effort'
     * n = 180 sperm whale encounters
  



The different GAMs will provide information about the overall spatial distribution patterns of sperm whales, whether different methods for detecting sperm whales affect the modeled relationships between sperm whale encounter rates and the environment, and use information from the acoustic data to test whether distribution patterns can be further delineated by behavior. 

$~$

### Environmental Variables  

All models incorporated biologically relevant environmental predictors that represented bathymetric features or oceanographic processes that act as proxies for mechanisms driving sperm whale prey distribution. The correlation between environmental variables was tested prior to model fitting. All variables included in the table below resulted in correlation coefficients < |0.6| (Figure 1).
Chlorophyll, EKE and wave power were log-transformed to reduce the skew and minimize the leverage of outlying data points during model fitting.

### Model Construction
A 25-km spatial resolution was used to compute the unit of analysis for sperm whale encounter rate. Preliminary models also tested a 10-km spatial resolution, but given the homogeneous nature of the data, increasing the spatial resolution did not result in any significant changes to the strength of correlations between encounter rate and environmental variables. 

Model data sets were divided into train and test data sets using a 70/30 split. All models were fit using thin-plate regression splines (the default basis) for the smoothers of the environmental predictors. Each smoother was limited to 3 degrees of freedom (k=3) to reduce overfitting parameters per recommendations from other studies building similar types of cetaceans distribution models. Models were also tested with a 2D spatial smoother ( s(Lon, Lat, k=10) ) to account for spatial autocorrelation within the data. The number of knots was increased to 10 based on model diagnostics to account for the complexity of the spatial smoother and minimize the risk of overfitting the data. The log of the effort was included as an offset to account for the variation in search effort per grid cell. 

GAMs were fitted using a negative binomial with a log-link function since this distribution is suitable for data sets consisting of relatively sparse count data with large numbers of zeros. This distribution fit the data better than a Tweedie distribution, which is also commonly used to fit cetacean occurrence data. Negative binomial models resulted in lower AIC, with higher adj. $R^2$ values and explained deviance. Smoothing parameters were optimized using restricted maximum likelihood (REML). Model selection was performed using automatic term selection, which approximated p-values for each predictor. Non-significant variables (α = 0.05) were iteratively excluded. 

* Note: Initial models included all candidate predictors. The best-fit models included only the significant variables resulting in maximum adjusted $R^2$ values and explained deviance.

Here, I present only the best-fit models with and without spatial smoothers to compare model performance and significant predictor variables to address my hypothesis and research objectives.

### Initial Conclusions for Combined Model


Both Combined models included Depth, Temp at 584 m, SSHsd, and yearly quarter as significant variables, each with similar effects on sperm whale encounter rate. 


Partial effects plots from Combined Model 1 showed sperm whale encounter rate to have a negative linear relationship with SSH and yearly quarter. The Combined Model 1 resulted in effects of Depth, Temp at 584 m, and SSHsd showed similar relationships where higher encounter rates were predicted at the minimum and maximum values of each variable.

Combined Model 2 (*with 2D spatial smoother) yielded the same significant variables as Combined Model 1 with the exception of SSH. The addition of the sighted sperm whale encounters may have introduced more variation into the data, which is best explained by including both of these variables in the model. Higher encounter rates are predicted at the lowest and highest temperatures for Temp at 584 m, which coincides to predictions from the spatial smoother. This variable relates the effects of temperatures at an average depth of sperm whale prey (primarily squids) to sperm whale encounter rate, which may suggest that these areas are more productive.
